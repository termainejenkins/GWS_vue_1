Issue: Incorrect Import Statement for createProxyMiddleware

When attempting to use createProxyMiddleware from the http-proxy-middleware package in a Node.js application, there was an issue with the import statement. The error message indicated that createProxyMiddleware is not a function.

Solution: Correct Import Statement

The issue was resolved by ensuring the correct import statement. The correct import syntax involves using curly braces around createProxyMiddleware since it is an exported member of the http-proxy-middleware module.

javascript
Copy code
import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'http-proxy-middleware';
This corrected the error and allowed the application to use createProxyMiddleware as intended.
